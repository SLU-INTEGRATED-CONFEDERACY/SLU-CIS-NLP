# Bontoc Lexicon Project

This project presents a digital lexicon of the Bontok langauge, an indigenous language spoken in Bontoc, Mountain Province, Philippines. Developed from academic, cultural, and community-based sources and validated by native speakers and teachers, the lexicon documents Bontok vocabulary with example usages and linguistic annotations. Addressing the limited availability of digital resources from Norther Luzon languages, it serves as a valuable tool for language documentation and preservation, providing a foundational reference for research, education, and future digital and computational applications while supporting the transmission of the Bontok language to future generations.
