# Lexicon Repository

A centralized, well-structured collection of multilingual lexicons, supporting resources, and research materials.  
This repository is maintained to aid linguistic research, NLP development, and language documentation efforts.

## Repository Structure

### **1. Language Folders**
Each folder is named after a specific language and typically includes:

- **Lexicon Files**  
  Raw or processed lexicon datasets for the language.

- **Local README**  
  Each language directory contains its own README detailing:  
  - Authors / compilers  
  - Metadata and version information  
  - Description of the lexicon  
  - Notes on data sources, formatting, or usage

---

### **2. Supplementary Folders**
These folders may include:

- **Research Papers**  
  Studies, theses, or publications involving the provided lexicons.

- **Implementations / Code Samples**  
  Scripts or tools demonstrating how to load, process, or integrate the lexicons into NLP workflows.
