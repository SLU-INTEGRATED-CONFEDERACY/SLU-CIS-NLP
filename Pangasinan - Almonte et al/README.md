# 📚 Pangasinan-English Lexicon Project

## ✨ Overview

The Pangasinan–English Lexicon Project is a structured digital dictionary translating Pangasinan words
into English. The lexicon is built using data extracted from Pangasinan dictionaries and Pangasinan
poems, ensuring authentic, contextual, and culturally accurate word usage. This project supports linguistic
preservation, academic research, and computational linguistics.

| **Data Format** | CSV, Excel |
| **Methodology** | Manual extraction, lemma identification, POS tagging, translation validation |

## 🧩 Lexicon Structure

Each lexicon entry contains standardized fields to maintain organization and consistency.

### Fields of the Lexicon
| Field Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pangasinan Word** | The surface form of the word |
| **Root Word / Lemma** | The base form used for classification |
| **English Equivalent** | The closest translation in English |
| **Part of Speech Tag** | Grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) |


## 📚 Data Sources & Collection Process
1.  **Pangasinan Dictionaries** 
* Used to gather standard word forms
* Provided base forms (lemmas)
* Helped validate English translations

2.  **Pangasinan Poems**
* Used for contextual meanings
* Revealed rare and poetic word forms
* Helped refine part-of-speech tagging

3.  **Cross-Verification** 
* Words were compared across multiple sources to ensure accuracy
* Context-based meanings were double-checked
### Sample Lexicon Entries

| Pangasinan Word | Root/Lemma | English Equivalent | POS |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *baley* | *baley* | town | noun |
| *mapteng* | *pten* | good/beautiful | adjective |
| *manmaká* | *maká* | to eat | verb |

## 💻 How to Use the Lexicon

The Pangasinan–English Lexicon is designed to be user-friendly for both academic and general purposes. Follow these steps to navigate and make the most of the lexicon:
1. **Search for Words**
* Users can look up Pangasinan words in the “Pangasinan Word” column.
* If the base or root form is known, searching the “Root/Lemma” column may provide additional results.

2. **Understand Meaning and Usage**
* Refer to the “English Equivalent” column for the closest translation.
* The Part of Speech (POS) column helps determine the grammatical role of the word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

3. **Explore Contextual Forms**
* Some words may appear in poems or literary texts in different forms. Check the Root/Lemma to identify the standard form.
* Cross-reference multiple entries to understand nuanced or poetic uses.

4. **Cross-Verification**
* Use the lexicon to compare words across different sources. This helps verify translations and ensures culturally accurate interpretations.

5. **Practical Applications**
* The lexicon can support language learning, translation projects, and computational analysis.
* For computational purposes, the structured format (CSV/Excel) allows easy integration with software tools for NLP or linguistic research.
